#### Search Guide

1. **Avoid Acronyms**\
   While FelixFusion can deconstruct some acronyms, providing full terms ensures more accurate results.
2. **Be Detailed**\
   The more specific your query, the better the quality of the results returned by FelixFusion.
3. **Use Filters Effectively**\
   For targeted searches involving solicitation numbers, PSC codes, or NAICS codes, leverage FelixFusion’s built-in filter functions. Avoid entering these codes directly in the search bar without filters.

#### Chat Interface

1. **Contextual Understanding**\
   FelixFusion’s agentic AI selects the best tools to respond to your queries based on gathered context.
2. **Explicit Instructions for Search**\
   Use commands like “search” to prompt the AI to look for specific information.
3. **Specific Queries**\
   Provide precise instructions, such as “Find Section L instructions,” to yield clearer and more relevant results compared to general terms like “Section L.”

#### Proposal Writing

1. **Start with Structure**\
   Use the Outline Generator to build a structured framework for your proposal. Custom instructions can refine this process further.
2. **Detailed Communication**\
   Replace vague commands like “write my proposal” with specific directives, e.g., “write my technical approach with a focus on compliance for healthcare and sustainability themes.”
3. **Inline and Document Chat**\
   Utilize inline chat for inserting text directly into your document or document chat for brainstorming. Highlight and right-click text for quick interaction with these tools.
4. **Segmented File Usage**\
   Organize files logically to enable FelixFusion to perform searches effectively using PursuitSearch, OrganizationSearch, or WebSearch.
